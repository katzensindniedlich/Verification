The automated verification system seems to declining me,  
because it can not find my plugin [bundle][plugin-file] separated into a sub branch (they aren't indexed).

And because I'm an introvert I use a dummy.


#### Why Separating?

- The Repo is more readable and understandable.
- The Bundle is excluded in cloning, release assets and checkouts.


#### Why a plugin to open dms?

- To view dms with users you no longer share a server with & without writing a /msg
- You can also view profiles discord wide :^)
